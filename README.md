# CircleMix

In this project, we collected 8841 glomeruli patches labeled with the [EasierPath](https://github.com/luyuzhe111/EasierPath) open source software to perform the 
fine-grained glomeruli classification. 

We proposed the CircleMix, a novel data augmentation optimized for for the ball-shaped biomedical objects, such as the glomeruli, to improve the performance of 
the classifier. A simple illustration is attached below.
