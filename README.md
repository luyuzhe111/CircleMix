# CircleMix

In this project, we collected 8841 glomeruli patches labeled with the EasierPath open source software https://github.com/luyuzhe111/EasierPath to perform the 
fine-grained glomeruli classification. 

We proposed the CircleMix, a novel data augmentation optimized for for the ballshaped biomedical objects, such as the glomeruli, to improve the performance of 
the classifier. A simple illustration is attached below.
